Zetaz still wears the trademark imp loincloth, though it bulges and shifts with his movements in a way that suggest a considerable flaccid size and large, full sack.  His shoulders are wrapped with studded leather and his wrists are covered with metallic bracers.  The imp has clearly invested in at least a little additional protection.
