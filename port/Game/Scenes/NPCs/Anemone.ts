Two feathery gills sprout from the middle of her chest, along the line of her spine and below her collarbone, and drape over her pair of small B-cup breasts.  Though you wouldn't describe her curves as generous, she sways her girly hips back and forth in a way that contrasts them to her slim waist quite attractively.  Protruding from her groin is a blue shaft with its head flanged by diminutive tentacles, and below that is a dark-blue pussy ringed by small feelers.  Further down are a pair of legs ending in flat sticky feet; proof of her aquatic heritage.  She smiles broadly and innocently as she regards you from her deep eyes.";
