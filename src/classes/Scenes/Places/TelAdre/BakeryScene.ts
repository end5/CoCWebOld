Surprised at your own audacity, you put the egg down again wondering where the thought came from.  Remembering why you are back here, your dilemma returns to the forefront of your mind with pressing urgency.  You walk over and pick up the jar of blue liquid; it is far more viscous than you imagined.  Taking everything into consideration, you're helping out here.
