She has plump lips and long, smooth blonde hair, though much of it is hidden behind a pointed, wide-brimmed hat.  Her robes are even blacker than she is, but she wields an alabaster staff that fairly sizzles with magical might.  Of course, her garments don't do much to conceal her gigantic breasts.  Though there are only two, they're large enough to dwarf the four tits most sand witches are packing.";
